# Ford Otosan Student Application System
This project is my internship project at Ford Otosan. The main motivation of the project is designing a platform that responsible for
job applications.


#### Description
The amount of the applications for internship is huge for big companies like Ford Otosan. So finding the best applicant in that pool is
very hard. This platform performs some pre-interview process for internship candidates. The successfull candidates will be taken for
more serious interview process. So the workload on HR will be lightened. 

This platform also has user system, so visitors signs up and creates their profile. So users doesn't have to re-fill areas for all applications.
Also there is an announcement page and carousel at main page to make sure student(or applicants) don't miss any deadline or new job poster.

The biggest plus for this application is that the platform is capable of taking interviews automatically. And interviews for every job poster
can be customized. Employee can change the topics of questions and the number of the questions. And the interview paper will be created randomly
with questions in the poll for every student. So you don't need to prepare an interview paper for every job poster and every student. The system
is capable of doing that process automatically.

### Future Work
- This platform can bu evolve for all job posters not only for internship applications. 
- Questions can be labeled as easy, medium and hard. So the probability of injustice paper distrubition removed. Some students can get very 
easy questions and others can get very hard questions because of the randomizing when creating interview paper.
- Reviews can be made by system. 
- Next interview dates can be arranged by the system instead of the employee.
